          <p1><b>ABOUT:</b> Mental health in India is a serious issue. From different regions, age groups, and genders, the issue of mental health has affected people of different backgrounds. I've decided to visualize data sourced from Kaggle in order to bring light to this serious issue and understand it's fatal effects.

        <p1><b>GETTING STARTED + PROCESS:</b>
            I used Kaggle's online Notebook to program my data. Kaggle offers packages which makes it convenient to code and work with data. 
            After inserting import statements, I searched through online resources to learn how to plot data. Since this was my first project
            with Python, I had a lot of trouble trying to decode syntax. I used online resources and some help from CS upperclassmen to 
            help me wit this project.

    <div class = "conclusion">
        <p1><b>CONCLUSION:</b>

            This project can help visualize the serious impacts of mental health. 
            Lives were taken by suicide the highest in Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu. 
            Age groups from 15-29 and 30-44 were taken by suicide more than any age group from 0-60+. 
            Males lives were taken by suicide more than females. <br> In terms of programming,
            I learned a lot about the different things you can do with Python. <b> I hope to
                learn more about Python syntax and expand upon this project in the months to come.
