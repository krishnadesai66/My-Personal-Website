This is a  project using HTML and CSS to give you a look into my life!

ABOUT:

I learned HTML and CSS back in high school in order to curate a website to display my photography. Over this winter break, I decided to revamp my website to display not only my photography portfolios, but also my skills and projects.

BUILT WITH:

CSS

Canva 

GoDaddy

GETTING STARTED + PROCESS:

I planned out my website by choosing a color scheme, font, and content I want posted. I then simply began coding. A great resource I used throughout the construction
of this project was w3schools, where I learned a lot of syntax and helpful information. I spent time testing the website to ensure that it was visually appealing and 
worked properly. I did run into a few road bumps, but nothing that Google couldn't solve. I specifically faced issues regarding content placement, but I eventually learned the 
importance of the "display" and "padding" properties. I hosted this website via GoDaddy.

CONCLUSION:

Through project, I learned a handful about HTML and CSS as well as the process of web design. I hope to build on this website going forward by adding more skills and photos. Looking back, I wish I had an organized timeline of building this project.
