          <p1><b>ABOUT:</b> I learned HTML and CSS back in high school in order to curate a website to display my photography. Over this winter break, 
              I decided to revamp my website to display not only my photography portfolios, but also my skills and projects.</p1>

        <p1><b>GETTING STARTED + PROCESS:</b>

            I planned out my website by choosing a color scheme, font, and content I want posted. I then simply began coding. A great resource 
            I used throughout the construction of this project was w3schools, where I learned a lot of syntax and helpful information.
             I spent time testing the website to ensure that it was visually appealing and worked properly. I did run into a few road bumps, 
             but nothing that Google couldn't solve. I specifically faced issues regarding 
            content placement, but I eventually learned the importance of the "display" and "padding" properties. I hosted this website via GoDaddy.</p1>

        <p1><b>CONCLUSION:</b>

            Through project, I learned a handful about HTML and CSS as well as the process of web design. I hope to build 
            on this website going forward by adding more skills and photos. Looking back, I wish I had an organized timeline 
            of building this project.</p1>
